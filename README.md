An Artificial Neural Network Model created using Numpy, Pandas.

This model predicts the Output Velocity of a Converging-Diverging Nozzle using the following parameters as input parameters:
-Convergence Length of Nozzle
-Divergence Length of Nozzle
-Inlet Diameter of Nozzle
-Exit Diameter of Nozzle
-Pressure applied at the inlet of the Nozzle

The model consists of a single hidden layer with 8 hidden neurons.

The model is trained using Batch Mode of Training and the average error in prediction of output is chosen as the criterion to optimize the network parameters.
